# Hangman
Team JavaFX Project for COMP 585
This is a destop game where the user enters a letter and tries to guess the word.
If they guess right, the letter is revealed.
If they guess wrong a part of Mr. Hangman is shown.
If they guess it in 6 moves of less, they win!
Otherwise they lose, the answer is shown and poor Mr.Hangman completed.
Not to worry though - They can try again with a new game & word.
Let's play Hangman!
